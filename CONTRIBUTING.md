## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD FOR REPORTING - e.g., a specific email address or link to a private reporting form]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

**1. Correction**
* **Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
* **Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**2. Warning**
* **Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
* **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban**
* **Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
* **Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**4. Permanent Ban**
* **Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
* **Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to VLN Concordia:

### Reporting Issues or Suggesting Enhancements
* **Report inaccuracies or gaps in existing content:** If you find information that is outdated, incorrect, or incomplete, please open an issue.
* **Suggest new disability entries:** If there's a disability not yet covered that you think should be, let us know by opening an issue.
* **Propose improvements:** Ideas for the database structure, navigation, or features are welcome.

**How to submit:** Open a **New Issue** on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/your-username/vln-concordia/issues). *(Replace path)*. Provide as much detail as possible.

### Contributing New Content (Disability Entries)
This is a primary way to contribute. We aim for comprehensive, well-researched, and sensitively written entries.

**Expertise & Knowledge Sources:**
* **Lived Experience:** First-hand accounts from individuals with disabilities are invaluable.
* **Caregivers & Family Members:** Perspectives from those supporting individuals with disabilities.
* **Healthcare Professionals & Researchers:** Clinical insights, research findings, and established knowledge.
* **Reputable Organizations:** Information from established disability advocacy groups, medical institutions, and research bodies.

**Content Requirements for Each Entry:**
Your entry should be a Markdown file and aim to cover the following sections (refer to existing well-structured entries or a template if provided by maintainers for guidance on structure and level of detail):
1.  **Overview/Definition:** What the disability is.
2.  **Characteristics/Symptoms:** Key features and how they manifest.
3.  **Causes and Onset:** Known or suspected causes, typical age/circumstances of onset.
4.  **Diagnosis:** How it's diagnosed, criteria used.
5.  **Co-occurring Conditions:** Common associated conditions.
6.  **Impact on Daily Life:** How it can affect individuals' lives (social, educational, occupational, personal).
7.  **Management, Treatment, and Support Strategies:** Available therapies, interventions, assistive technologies, coping mechanisms, support systems.
8.  **Dispelling Myths & Fostering Understanding:** Addressing common misconceptions.
9.  **Resources (Optional but Recommended):** Links to reputable organizations, further reading.
10. **References (If applicable):** Cite sources for medical or research-based information.

**Language and Tone:**
* Use clear, accessible language.
* Maintain a neutral, objective, and empathetic tone.
* Prioritize **Person-First Language** (e.g., "a person with epilepsy" rather than "an epileptic"), unless a specific community prefers identity-first language (e.g., "Autistic person"). When in doubt, use person-first.
* Be respectful and sensitive to the diverse experiences of individuals.

**Submission Process:**
1.  **Claim an Issue or Propose a New Entry:** Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/your-username/vln-concordia/issues) for entries that are needed. If you want to work on a new disability not listed, open a new issue first to propose it and discuss the scope with maintainers.
2.  **Research & Draft:** Gather information from reliable sources and your own expertise. Draft the content in a new Markdown file.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request:** See "Contribution Workflow" below.

*If you have valuable information but are not comfortable with Markdown or GitHub, please open an issue and share your information there. Project maintainers or other contributors may be able to help format and integrate it.*

### Updating or Enhancing Existing Content
If you find an existing entry that needs updates, clarifications, or additional information:
1.  Open an **Issue** to discuss the proposed changes.
2.  Alternatively, make the changes in your forked repository and submit a **Pull Request**.

### Technical Contributions
If you have skills in web development, data management, accessibility, or scripting, you might contribute to:
* Improving the structure or presentation of the database.
* Developing tools for navigation (e.g., the planned programmatic in-page navigation).
