# VLN Concordia

An open-source, community-driven database for comprehensive information on disabilities.

---

## Overview

VLN Concordia is an open-source project dedicated to creating an extensive database of disabilities. The primary objective is to provide detailed, multi-faceted information to foster a thorough understanding of each condition. The name "Concordia" signifies the project's aim to synthesize diverse knowledge, research, and lived experiences into a cohesive resource. This initiative expands on the work of VisualLinkNetwork to cover a broader spectrum of disabilities.

## Content

This database is designed to host in-depth entries on a diverse range of disabilities. Each entry aims for a comprehensive structure, covering key informational points such as definitions, characteristics, etiology, diagnostic criteria, co-occurring conditions, daily impact, management strategies, and clarifications of common misconceptions.

The project's scope is the progressive inclusion of numerous disabilities, developed through community contributions and thorough research. Contributors interested in creating new entries should refer to our contribution guidelines (e.g., in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or an issue template) for details on the preferred structure and format.
