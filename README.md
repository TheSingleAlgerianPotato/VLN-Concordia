## Overview

**VLN Concordia** is an open-source, community-driven project dedicated to building an extensive and accessible database of information on a wide range of disabilities. Our primary objective is to provide detailed, multi-faceted information to foster a deeper understanding of each condition, combat misinformation, and support individuals, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers.

The name "Concordia" signifies the project's core aim: to synthesize diverse knowledge, rigorous research, and invaluable lived experiences into a single, cohesive, and reliable resource. This initiative expands upon the foundational work of the VisualLinkNetwork to encompass a broader spectrum of disabilities.

We believe that accessible, comprehensive information is crucial for empowerment, advocacy, and building a more inclusive society.

## Content & Structure

This database hosts in-depth entries on various disabilities, meticulously structured to cover key aspects:

*   **Definition & Overview:** Clear explanation of the condition.
*   **Characteristics & Symptoms:** Detailed description of common traits.
*   **Etiology (Causes) & Genetics:** Information on origins and hereditary factors.
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:** How the condition is identified.
*   **Co-occurring Conditions:** Related health issues or challenges.
*   **Impact on Daily Life:** How the condition affects individuals' lives.
*   **Management & Treatment Strategies:** Current approaches to care and support.
*   **Common Misconceptions:** Clarifying frequent misunderstandings.

### Data Organization

All information is stored as Markdown (`.md`) files within the `/data` directory of this repository.

*   Each disability has its own dedicated folder (e.g., `/data/down_syndrome/`).
*   Inside each folder, information is provided in separate Markdown files for each available language, named using the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., `en.md` for English, `ar.md` for Arabic).

```
data/
├── autism_spectrum_disorder/
│   ├── ar.md
│   └── en.md
├── down_syndrome/
│   ├── ar.md
│   └── en.md
└── ... (other disabilities)
```

## How to Use This Database

*   **Browse the Repository:** Navigate directly through the `/data` directory to find the disability you are interested in and select the desired language file.
*   **Programmatic Access (API):** For developers or applications needing to access this data programmatically, a simple API is available. Please refer to the **[API Documentation (API.md)](API.md)** for detailed instructions on endpoints, parameters, and usage.
